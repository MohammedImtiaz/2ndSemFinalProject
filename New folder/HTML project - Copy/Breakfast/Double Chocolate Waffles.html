Ingredients<br>
Makes about 10 waffles<br>
Chocolate Waffles<br>
1 3/4 cup (220g) all-purpose flour<br>
1/2 cup (60g) unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1/3 cup (70g) brown sugar<br>
2 tsp (8g) baking powder<br>
1/2 tsp (3g) baking soda<br>
1/2 tsp (3g) salt<br>
1/2 tsp (1g) cinnamon<br>
2 large eggs, separated, at room temperature<br>
2 tbsp (30g) sugar<br>
2 cups (480g) buttermilk, room temperature<br>
1/3 cup (70g) oil (I used canola oil)<br>
1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract<br>
2/3 cup (120g) bittersweet chocolate chips<br>
Chocolate Sauce<br>
1/2 cup (60g) unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1/3 cup (70g) sugar<br>
1/4 tsp (1g) salt<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) water<br>
1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract<br><br>
Directions<br>
Prepare chocolate sauce. In a medium saucepan whisk cocoa powder with sugar and salt. Add water and mix to combine. Place over medium low heat and bring to boil. Simmer for 1 minute, stirring continuously. Remove from heat, add vanilla  and set aside to cool until ready to use. Prepare chocolate waffles. In a large bowl whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Separate the eggs. Mix the egg yolks with sugar until smooth and creamy. Add oil, one cup of buttermilk and vanilla and whisk to combine. Add flour mixture and mix until well combined. Add the other cup of buttermilk and whisk to combine. Whip the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the two tablespoons of sugar and whip until stiff peaks form.Gently fold them into the batter. Incorporate chocolate chips. Preheat your waffle iron and spray both surfaces with cooking spray or grease with oil. Pour about ? to 1/2 cup batter onto one side of the iron and close it. Cook according to your waffle maker instructions. To keep them crisp until you prepare the others, place the cooked ones in the preheated oven at 200F (100C) on a cooling rack . It's best to serve them immediately, while still hot, with whipped cream or ice cream if desires and with some fresh berries and chocolate sauce for a more decadent treat. Enjoy!<br>
