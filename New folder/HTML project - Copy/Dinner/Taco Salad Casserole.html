<p1>This casserole tastes like a taco salad and is a breeze to assemble. I crush tortilla chips to form a bottom layer, then spread on refried beans, a spicy meat mixture and cheese.<hr>

Ingredients<br>
1 pound ground beef<br>
1/4 cup chopped onion<br>
1/4 cup chopped green pepper<br>
1 envelope taco seasoning<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
1 cup crushed tortilla chips<br>
1 can (16 ounces) refried beans<br>
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese<br>
Toppings: Chopped lettuce and tomatoes, sliced ripe olives, sour cream and picante sauce<br>
<br><br>
Directions<br>
In a large skillet, cook beef, onion and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Cook and stir until thickened, about 3 minutes; set aside.
Place chips in a greased 8-in. square baking dish. In a small bowl, stir refried beans; spread over chips. Top with beef mixture and cheese.
Bake, uncovered, at 375Â° until heated through, 15-20 minutes. Top with lettuce, tomatoes and olives. Serve with sour cream and picante sauce.<br>
