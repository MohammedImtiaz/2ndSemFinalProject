<p>A textbook for the chef, this is an excellent source of fundamental techniques that every cook should know. From learning how to make a roux to essential information on safe food handling practices, this is one of those books that will continually come off the shelf when you’re in need of a quick refresher. In addition to being an excellent guide, it also has almost 1000 recipes that cover contemporary and classic recipes. No kitchen is complete without this book, and it’s often referred to as ’the bible’ by professional chefs. Click here to buy it today.</p>

<h1>The Flavor Bible by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg</h1>
<img  src="The-Flavor-Bible-900x600.jpg" width="305" height="260" align="center" alt="The Flavor Bible by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg" />
<p>This is the most frequently used book on my kitchen shelf. It’s basically an encyclopedia of flavors and shows you what flavors work well with others. This book is best used by seasoned chefs and experienced home cooks, but it’s one that can be found on the steel counters of most professional kitchens. It is the winner of the 2009 James Beard Book Award for Best Book and is the number one reference book in my opinion. Click here to get your copy</p>
